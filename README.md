select arrival_date_year, hotel,
round(sum((stays_in_weekend_nights + stays_in_week_nights) * adr), 2) as revenue
from hotels
group by arrival_date_year, hotel
sql
Copy
Edit
-- Data Union and Joins
with hotels as (
  select * from dbo.['2018$']
  union
  select * from dbo.['2019$']
  union
  select * from dbo.['2020$']
)

select * from hotels 
left join dbo.market_segment$ on hotels.market_segment = dbo.market_segment$.market_segment
left join dbo.meal_cost$ on dbo.meal_cost$.meal = hotels.meal
